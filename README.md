# Breadth-First Search (BFS) in Python

This project demonstrates how the **Breadth-First Search (BFS)** algorithm works using a simple graph structure.

BFS is used to find the shortest path in an unweighted graph (where all edges have equal cost). It explores all neighbors *level by level* before moving deeper.



## 📁 Contents

- `bfs.py` — The Python script that runs the BFS algorithm.
- Example graph (tree structure)
- Printed step-by-step exploration
- Reconstructed path from start to goal



## 📌 How It Works

- Uses a **FIFO queue** to explore nodes in order
- Tracks visited nodes to avoid revisiting
- Builds the shortest path from the start to the goal
